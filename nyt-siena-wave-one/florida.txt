rv.weight - weight for registered voters

turnout.score - modeled probability of turnout; the model was fit on the subset of the L2 voter file (for both active and inactive voters) that was registered before election day 2012. This probably slightly overstates turnout propensity, since the current file of pre-2012 registrants is probably ‘cleaner’ than the actual file in Nov. 2012 (i.e.: someone who had moved in Sept 2012 might have still been on the L2 file in Nov. 2012, but would no longer be part of the L2 file)
lv.weight - likely voter weight — registration weight * probability of turnout (which is 50% self-reported and 50% from turnout score)

The New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll of 867 likely voters in Florida was conducted from Sept. 10 to 14.

The sample was selected from an L2 voter file stratified by age, region, race and a modeled turnout score. Voter records from each strata were selected in inverse proportion to the anticipated response rate for each strata, based on a June-July test.

Interviews were conducted on both landline and cellphones and in English and Spanish. Over all, 59 percent of interviews were completed on cellphones, and 4 percent were completed in Spanish. Interviewers asked for the person listed on the voter file; no interviews were attempted with other individuals available at the number.

The sample was balanced to match the demographic and political characteristics of active registered voters in the L2 voter file by age, race, gender, party registration, region and a modeled turnout score. The voter file data on respondents, not the self-reported information provided by respondents, was used for weighting.

Likely voters were determined by averaging a self-reported likely-voter screen and a modeled turnout score.

• Self-reported likely voters were those who indicated that they were "almost certain" or "very likely" to vote, or rated their chance of voting as a "9" or "10" on a scale from 1 to 10.

• The turnout score was based on a model of turnout in the 2012 presidential election. The probabilties were applied to 2016.

The probability that a registered voter would turn out was based on the average of whether they were a self-reported voter and their modeled turnout score.
