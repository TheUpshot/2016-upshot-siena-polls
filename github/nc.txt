The New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll of 782 likely voters in North Carolina was conducted from Sept. 16 to 19.

The sample was selected from an L2 voter file stratified by age, race and a modeled turnout score. Voter records from each strata were selected in inverse proportion to the anticipated response rate for each strata, based on a June-July test.

Over all, 44 percent of interviews were completed on cellphones. Interviewers asked for the person listed on the voter file; no interviews were attempted with other individuals available at the number.

The sample was balanced to match the demographic and political characteristics of active registered voters in the L2 voter file by age, race, gender, party registration, region and a modeled turnout score. The voter file data on respondents, not the self-reported information provided by respondents, was used for weighting.

Likely voters were determined by averaging a self-reported likely-voter screen and a modeled turnout score.

• Self-reported likely voters were those who indicated that they were "almost certain" or "very likely" to vote, or rated their chance of voting as a "9" or "10" on a scale from 1 to 10.

• The turnout score was based on a model of turnout in the 2012 presidential election. The probabilities were applied to 2016.

The probability that a registered voter would turn out was based on the average of whether they were a self-reported voter and their modeled turnout score.
